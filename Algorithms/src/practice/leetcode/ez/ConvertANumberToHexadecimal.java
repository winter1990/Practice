/**
 * @bitwise
 *
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
 * All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 * The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single
 * zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * The two's complement of an N-bit number is defined as its complement with respect to 2N.
 * For instance, for the three-bit number 010, the two's complement is 110, because 010 + 110 = 1000.
 *
 * hexadecimal -> base 16
 * 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f(15) 10(16)
 * build an array as the map
 * while num is not 0, % 16
 * get the character in array
 *
