conclusion of hashing function 

* generally hashs take values and multiply it by a prime number
    ```
    int hash = 7;
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen; i++) {
        hash = hash*31 + charAt(i);
    }
    ```

* reason to use prime number
  * distribute data among hash buckets
  
* handling collisions
  * if two or more objects point to same bucket, store them in a linked list
  * the hash table is an array of linked lists
  * java 8 HashMap implementation â€“ if a bucket size goes beyond the threshold, the linked list gets replaced with a tree map. 
  * This allows achieving O(logn) look up instead of O(n).
