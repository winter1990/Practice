/**
 * @array
 *
 * In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.
 * When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.
 * If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.
 * (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)
 *
 * Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
 * Explanation:
 * ExamRoom(10) -> null
 * seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
 * seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
 * seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
 * seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
 * leave(4) -> null
 * seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
