Decorator Pattern

when the functionality of one particular product is expected to be built from a base product
and various other related sub-products or fixtures, we can rely on the Decorator

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality
keeping class methods signature intact
